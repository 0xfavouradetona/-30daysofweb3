# Basic Sample Hardhat Project
https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x0DB8c9F46F9E35A2a6D5e34635A28AE315fbD51E
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
